# FlexMode — Starter Bundle (Deployable)

## Quick start (local)
1. Copy files to a folder.
2. Place your real PDF at `protected-files/flexmode-starter.pdf` (replace the placeholder file).
3. Create `.env` from `.env.example` and fill Razorpay keys.
4. Install deps: `npm install`
5. Start: `npm start`
6. Open: `http://localhost:4000`

## Deploy to Vercel / Render / Railway
- For Render/Railway: deploy as a Node service, set environment variables in dashboard.
- For Vercel: this project is a single server file; prefer Render/Railway. Ask me if you want a Vercel serverless conversion.

## Notes
- Replace the placeholder PDF with your real PDF before going live.
- Do not commit `.env`.
